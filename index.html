        <h3 class="mission">Changing the lives of children and young people,

          HOPE foundation works to bring about change in the lives of children, young people and vulnerable individuals. We educate children. We provide healthcare. We give children, women and the aged a safe home. We train young people for a living. Afterwards, we help them find jobs and even start their own businesses.
          
          Driven by a team of over 500 people and many more volunteers and partners, our work spans across 19 cities in India. Our mission is to bring hope to those with none and change the lives of everyone we work with, including our staff, donors, volunteers and partners. Every year, through our work, we impact the lives of over 50,000 children, women and men.</h3>

    <h3 class="mission">Over 250,000 children are getting ready for a better future at HOPE foundations schools, non-formal education programs and tuition centers. Most of our students come from economically disadvantaged families with no easy access to quality education.

      We focus on the overall development of each child. The curricula at our schools are designed to motivate children to stay in school by making learning fun, interactive and engaging. We do this through computer-aided learning and digitised lessons (through software such as iLearning Hotspot, English Helper, Zaya and Experifun), a wide range of extra-curricular activities and regular training of teachers to encourage innovative teaching. We pay special attention to the education of girls.
      
      Our education support program, Cradle to Career ensures that a child completes her education, is in good health and has a choice between higher studies or a vocation after school. The program runs in seven places where over 2,500 children are on their way to finishing school.</h3>

The students also learn spoken English and life skills. Upon completion of the course, we help them find jobs through placements and job fairs.</h3>
